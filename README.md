# EFIGenieSTM32F103C

This barely fits in STM32F103C8 (64KB) with optimization for size</br>
This barely fits in STM32F103CB (128KB) with no optimizations (DEBUG)</br>
Plan to move to Black Pill (STM32F401/411) at least for debugging. It provides more flash, memory, and speed. The floating point instructions will make it a lot faster.
