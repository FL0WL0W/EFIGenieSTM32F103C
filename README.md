# EFIGenieSTM32F103C

Running out of memory with basic config. not sure all features will fit</br></br>
This barely fits in STM32F103C8 (64KB) with optimization for size (55KB + config). have not even started adding the data logging or flash utility</br></br>
This barely fits in STM32F103CB (128KB) with no optimizations (DEBUG)</br></br>
Plan to move to Black Pill (STM32F401/411) at least for debugging. It provides more flash, memory, and speed. The floating point instructions will make it a lot faster.
